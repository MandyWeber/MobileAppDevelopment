# MobileAppDevelopment
This mobile app website is a site based on my favorite musical artists. It is divided into two pages of rock music and comedic music.
There is a panel on the left hand side that takes the user to other pages like, form, grid, favorite's, and user favorite's. 
On the main page there are 4 links to take you to either rock bands, comedy artists, form, or grid and they use a little arrow icon pointing to the right.
When you click on rock bands or comedy artisits it will bring you to a page that has the list of my favorites and then links to my favorite album on Spotify.
When you go to form it will bring up a random form for the user to fill out.
When you go to grid it bring you to a page with a grid of pictures of the artists.
Below those 4 links are buttons that bring you to various merch websites or Spotify playlists and they have star icons.
All pages have a back button with an arrow pointing to the left.
